      <h1 style="text-align:center;">Things My Dog has Survived Eating</h1>
      <p style="color:#e0ffff;">My dog, Larry, is truly one of a kind. He is a nine-year-old Goldendoodle who is as stubborn
today as he was on Christmas Day in 2013. The day we brought him home for the first time. In
my family, Larry is known as our own personal “Marley.” He is stubborn, mischievous, ornery,
high-maintenance and headstrong. We like to say that he is more of a person than a dog
because of his firm opinions, weird quirks and his frequent backtalking. But, despite all these
frustrating qualities, Larry still has a heart of gold and continues to win over the hearts of
everyone he meets.
	      
Over the years, Larry has gotten into trouble thousands of times. Whether it be digging a
massive hole in the backyard, having to be chased through the back nine of a golf course,
chewing a hole through our drywall or barking at us in the middle of a Zoom call to get his arm
rubbed, his mischief extends far beyond most people’s typical pet experiences. But one of the
things that old age has not stopped him from doing is eating EVERYTHING. If Larry is around,
you cannot have slippers on the floor, food on the counters, open bedroom doors or anything of
value that his 110 lb. body can reach. Throughout his life, he has survived fully consuming more
toxic foods and miscellaneous items than any dog I have ever seen. So, because of this
incredible feat, here is a little tribute to my dog Larry – the most stubborn old mutt and very best
friend that anyone could ever have – and a few of the delicious meals he has indulged in
throughout his lifetime. Enjoy.</p>
